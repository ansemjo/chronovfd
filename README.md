This project is still a work-in-progress.

The first version was built completely on protoboard and can be seen

## VFD Driver PCB

This is basically the Universal VFD PSU by Rolo Kamp on a board together
with a Microchip HV5128 driver. It's the "front plate" for the clock.

KiCad project in `hardware/vfddriver.pro`.
